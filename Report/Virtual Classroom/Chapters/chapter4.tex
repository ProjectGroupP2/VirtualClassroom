{\bfseries JAVA:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Description:

A high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. Java was originally called OAK, and was designed for handheld devices and set-top boxes. Oak was unsuccessful so in 1995 Sun changed the name to Java and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning World Wide Web. 

It is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.It is intended to let application developers �write once, run anywhere� (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled to byte code that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

\item JAVA platfrom:

It is the name given to the computing platform from Oracle that helps users to run and develop Java applications. The platform does not just enable a user to run and develop a Java application, but also features a wide variety of tools that can help developers work efficiently with the Java programming language.

{\bfseries The platform consists of two essential software�s:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
\item Java Development Kit (JDK)
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

{\bfseries Eclipse:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Description:

Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Written mostly in Java, Eclipse can be used to develop applications. By means of various plug-ins, Eclipse may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages:  C, C++, COBOL, Fortran, JavaScript, Natural, Perl and PHP. It can also be used to develop packages for the software Mathematical. 

\item Android Development Tools for Eclipse:

ADT (Android Developer Tools) is a plug-in for Eclipse that provides a suite of tools that are integrated with the Eclipse IDE. It offers you access many features that help you develop Android applications quickly. ADT provides GUI access to many of the command line SDK tools as well as a UI design tool for rapid prototyping, designing, and building of your application's user interface. Because ADT is a plug-in for Eclipse, you get the functionality of a well-established IDE, along with Android-specific features that are bundled with ADT. Developing in Eclipse with ADT is highly recommended and is the fastest way to get started. With the guided project setup it provides, as well as tools integration, custom XML editors, and debug output pane, ADT gives you an incredible boost in developing Android applications.

\end{enumerate}

{\bfseries MYSQL:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Description:

 MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small and big businesses. MySQL is developed, marketed, and supported by MySQL AB, which is a Swedish company. MySQL isbecoming so popular because of many good reasons. MySQL is released under an open-source license. So you have nothing to pay to use it. MySQL is a very powerful program in its own right. It handles a large subset of the functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages. MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language. MySQL works on many operating systems and with many laguages including PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc. MySQL works very quickly and works well even with large data sets. MySQL is very friendly to PHP, the most appreciated language for web development. MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table. The default  size limit for a table is 4GB, but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle it) to a theoretical limit of 8 million terabytes (TB). MySQL is customizable. The open-source GPL license allows programmers to modify the MySQL software to  their own specific environments.
 

\end{enumerate}

{\bfseries PHP Script:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Description:

PHP is a program that gets installed on top of your web server software. It works with versions of Apache , Microsoft IIS and other server software packages. We use PHP by inserting PHP code inside the HTML that makes up your website. When a client  visits a web page that contains this code, your server executes it. That’s why you need to install your own server in order to test PHP locally the server is the brain here, not your browser. Users don’t need any special plug-ins or anything to see your PHP in action it gets to the end user as regular old-fashioned HTML. PHP is a scripting language, like HTML. That means that code does not need to be compiled before it gets used it gets processed on the fly as necessary. 
 PHP is an open-source language, and PHP.net is its control center, with extensive reference material about the language and tips sent in by users across the globe. PHP.net has exceptional, deep information about the language, but it can be a little cryptic for the newcomer.  


\end{enumerate}

{\bfseries XAMPP:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Description:

XAMPP requires only one zip, tar, 7z, or exe file to be downloaded and run, and little or no configuration of the various components that make up the web server is required. XAMPP is regularly updated to incorporate the latest releases of Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl. It also comes with a number of other modules including OpenSSL and phpMyAdmin.Self-contained, multiple instances of XAMPP can exist on a single computer, and any given instance can be copied from one computer to another.
Officially, XAMPP's designers intended it for use only as a development tool, to allow website designers and programmers to test their work on their own computers without any access to the Internet. To make this as easy as possible, many important security features are disabled by default. In practice, however, XAMPP is sometimes used to actually serve web pages on the World Wide Web. A special tool is provided to password-protect the most important parts of the package. XAMPP also provides support for creating and manipulating databases in MySQL and SQLite among others.
Once XAMPP is installed, it is possible to treat a localhost like a remote host by connecting using an FTP client. Using a program like FileZilla has many advantages when installing a content management system (CMS) like Joomla or WordPress. It is also possible to connect to localhost via FTP with an HTML editor.
